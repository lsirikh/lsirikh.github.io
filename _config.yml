# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

#To set up your environment to develop this theme, 
# clone/fork the repo and run bundle install.

#To test your theme, run bundle exec jekyll serve
# and open your browser at http://localhost:4000/. 
# This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. 
# Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to 
# test your theme's contents. As you make 
# modifications to your theme and to your content, 
# your site will regenerate and you should see the 
# changes in the browser after a refresh, just like 
# normal.
